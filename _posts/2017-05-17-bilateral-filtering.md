title: Real-time Bilateral Filtering
excerpt_separator: ------------------------------
---



Many users have become accustomed to reducing wrinkles, freckles, and various blemishes from human subjects for a more visually appealing image or video. 

To solve this problem, an effective way is to apply an edge-preserving filtering called ***bilateral filter***. However, a vanilla bilateral filter has a high computational cost necessitating a powerful CPU / GPU to process full HD images in real-time. So I had been looking for an efficientÂ alternative algorithm, and finally found

that can achieve a good trade-off. 

I made a [lightweight C++ library](https://github.com/ufoym/RecursiveBF) for this algorithm, and obtained the following results (RecursiveBF):

The algorithm is pretty fast compared with most edge-preserving filtering methods
- computational complexity is linear in both input size and dimensionality:
- takes about 43 ms to process a one megapixel color image (i7 1.8GHz & 4GB mem)
- about 18x faster than *Fast high-dimensional filtering using the permutohedral lattice*
- about 86x faster than *Gaussian kd-trees for fast high-dimensional filtering*

For more details of the algorithm, please refer to the original paper.
